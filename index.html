DALC Calendar App is a cloud-based, synchronized calendar for tracking and analyzing employee hours. The app was developed for <a href="http://www.dolanlearning.com/"> Dolan Academy and Learning Center</a> in order to help keep add up teachers' billable hours at the end of each month. It is primarily intended for small businesses with irregular hours, which might otherwise have to devote extensive time and resources to tracking these hours. While the app is free to download, there is a monthly fee for administrators of organizations. Users who then join these organizations do not have to pay.
<H2><B>Getting started</B></H2>
Once you have installed the app from the store, launching it will take you to the login screen. Here, ensure that you are in registration mode rather than login mode by tapping the button at the bottom that says "register instead". Fill out the form with your username, password and email, and then confirm your registration using a verification code that will be sent to your email. Once your account is confirmed, return to the login screen.
<P>Log in using your newly created username and password. You will be taken to the organization screen, where you can create or log into organizations. These essentially represent businesses or other groups using a shared calendar. If you create an organization, you will be prompted to suscribe. Doing so will allow you to adminstrate you organization's calendar, manage its employee list, accept or deny new users, and set user permissions. Note that if you have a subscription, you can administrate an unlimited number of organizations without increasing the cost.
<P>If you want to join an existing organization created by someone else, you must first be approved as a user by its administrator. Tap the "search for organization" text field and enter the name of the organization you want to join (it is case-sensitive). Once it is found and entered into your list of known organizations, you can scroll to it, select it, and apply to join it by tapping the "request access" button. Your request will then need to be approved by the organization's administrator, after which you will be able to log in to the organization and view its calendar.
<H2><B>Setting up a new organization</B></H2>
Once you are logged into a new organization as its administrator, you can set it up by adding employees and categories of work, as well as accepting new users. To add employees and categories, tap the gear in the lower right, and then tap "global settings" in the popover that appears. You will need to add at least one employee and at least one category before you can add events to your calendar. From this view, you can also change the color coding of employees, which determines how their events will appear on the calendar.
<P>If you are an admin, you can accept new users to your organization by navigating to the main calendar view, tapping the gear in the lower-right, and then tapping "user list". This will let you see the list of users in your organization, as well as users who have applied to join it. You can approve or deny these pending users, as well as change the permissions of users that have joined the organization. You can also associate users with employees so that the app will know which employee is using. If you are not the adminstrator, you can still see this view, although you won't have access to all of the same actions as the administrator.
<H2><B>Adding and editing events</B></H2>
From the main calendar view, you can add events by tapping the '+' button in the lower-right of the schedule view. Editing events is done by tapping on an event in the schedule view, and works similarly to adding events. Events are defined by event text, start time, end time, employee, and category. Event text describes the work being done in a specific way. For instance, a tutor working with a student would put the student's name as the event text. A category, such as "teaching", describes the event more generally. When the app adds up employees' hours, it can break them down by category, so it can be useful to assign different categories to types of work that pay different hourly rates. The "completed" switch should be on if an employee has completed an event, and off if the event is scheduled for the future or cancelled. An event can only be cancelled when it is being edited, and a reason for cancellation must be entered. Cancelled events will still appear on the calendar to indicate that they were scheduled at some point, but deleting events will remove them permanently.
<P>Events can repeat over time. You can set an event to repeat at the same time on particular days every week for a set period of time, or indefinitely. If an event is set to repeat indefinitely, then the completed switch should be left off to ensure that events in the future are not marked as completed before they actually happen. When editing a repeating event, you can choose to change all events in the series (including those before the instance you selected), the event you selected and all events after it, or only the event you selected. The same is true for deleting events.
<P>After adding events for a few different employees, you may noticed thin colored lines appearing on the calendar view. These represent events that are "offscreen" because they belong to employees other than the one you have selected. They will be the same color as the employee they belong to, and occupy the same height on the grid as the full event. This can be helpful for determining at a glance which employees are working at any given time. If you tap the "show all employees" button, all employees' events will be shown at once and these lines will not appear.
<H2><B>Adding employee hours</B></H2>
You can reach the view for automatically adding employee hours by tapping the gear and then "add up hours". You can generate hour summaries either by employee or by event text. Event text is case-sensitive and will show all events belonging to all employees that have the given event text. The summaries will show up in a scrollable pane and include a breakdown of events according to whether they are completed, cancelled, or neither, as well as by category. Included in the summary will be "discrepancies", events that are neither completed nor cancelled. These are tracked because they may represent events that an employee forgot to log, and knowing the date and time on which they occurred makes it simpler to find out whether the employee actually completed the event.
<P>Hour summaries can be sent from DALC Calendar to your Dropbox if you have a Dropbox account and have the app installed on your iDevice. This will allow you to copy and paste the summary information or save a record of the summary. To send a summary after it is generated, simply tap the "send to Dropbox" button.  If you do not have a Dropbox account or the Dropbox app, tapping the button will prompt you to sign up.
<H2><B>Organization subscription</B></H2>
As stated previously, the app allows you to join organizations for free, and host an unlimited number of organizations for a monthly subscription fee. However, I have had only a limited ability to test the subscription system before releasing the app on the store, so please contact me using the email address at the bottom of this page if you encounter any issues, and I will try my best to resolve them. When you first sign up for the app, you are given a one-month free trial, after which you will be billed via iTunes. If at any point you would like to cancel your subscription, follow the instructions explained on <a href=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039>this</a> page. Otherwise, you subscription should renew automatically. If you are the admin of an organization and other members see a message that the subscription has expired (when in fact it has not), you may need to log in to the app in order to refresh the expiration date.
