DALC Calendar App is a cloud-based, synchronized calendar for tracking and analyzing employee hours. The app was developed for <a href="http://www.dolanlearning.com/"> Dolan Academy and Learning Center</a> in order to help keep add up teachers' billable hours at the end of each month. It is primarily intended for small businesses with irregular hours, which might otherwise have to devote extensive time and resources to tracking these hours. While the app is free to download, there is a monthly fee for administrators of organizations. Users who then join these organizations do not have to pay.
<H2><B>Getting started</B></H2>
Once you have installed the app from the store, launching it will take you to the login screen. Here, ensure that you are in registration mode rather than login mode by tapping the button at the bottom that says "register instead". Fill out the form with your username, password and email, and then confirm your registration using a verification code that will be sent to your email. Once your account is confirmed, return to the login screen.
<P>Log in using your newly created username and password. You will be taken to the organization screen, where you can create or log into organizations. These essentially represent businesses or other groups using a shared calendar. If you create an organization, you will be prompted to suscribe. Doing so will allow you to adminstrate you organization's calendar, manage its employee list, accept or deny new users, and set user permissions. Note that if you have a subscription, you can administrate an unlimited number of organizations without increasing the cost.
<P>If you want to join an existing organization created by someone else, you must first be approved as a user by its administrator. Tap the "search for organization" text field and enter the name of the organization you want to join (it is case-sensitive). Once it is found and entered into your list of known organizations, you can scroll to it, select it, and apply to join it by tapping the "request access" button. Your request will then need to be approved by the organization's administrator, after which you will be able to log in to the organization and view its calendar.
