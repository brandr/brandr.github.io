DALC Calendar App is a cloud-based, synchronized calendar for tracking and analyzing employee hours. The app was developed for <a href="http://www.dolanlearning.com/"> Dolan Academy and Learning Center</a> in order to help keep add up teachers' billable hours at the end of each month. It is primarily intended for small businesses with irregular hours, which might otherwise have to devote extensive time and resources to tracking these hours. While the app is free to download, there is a monthly fee for administrators of organizations. Users who then join these organizations do not have to pay.
<H2><B>Getting started</B></H2>
Once you have installed the app from the store, launching it will take you to the login screen. Here, ensure that you are in registration mode rather than login mode by tapping the button at the bottom that says "register instead". Fill out the form with your username, password and email, and then confirm your registration using a verification code that will be sent to your email. Once your account is confirmed, return to the login screen.
<P>Log in using your newly created username and password. You will be taken to the organization screen, where you can create or log into organizations. These essentially represent businesses or other groups using a shared calendar. If you create an organization, you will be prompted to suscribe. Doing so will allow you to adminstrate you organization's calendar, manage its employee list, accept or deny new users, and set user permissions. Note that if you have a subscription, you can administrate an unlimited number of organizations without increasing the cost.
<P>If you want to join an existing organization created by someone else, you must first be approved as a user by its administrator. Tap the "search for organization" text field and enter the name of the organization you want to join (it is case-sensitive). Once it is found and entered into your list of known organizations, you can scroll to it, select it, and apply to join it by tapping the "request access" button. Your request will then need to be approved by the organization's administrator, after which you will be able to log in to the organization and view its calendar.
<H2><B>Setting up a new organization</B></H2>
Once you are logged into a new organization as its administrator, you can set it up by adding employees and categories of work, as well as accepting new users. To add employees and categories, tap the gear in the lower right, and then tap "global settings" in the popover that appears. You will need to add at least one employee and at least one category before you can add events to your calendar. From this view, you can also change the color coding of employees, which determines how their events will appear on the calendar.
<P>If you are an adimn, you can accept new users to your organization by navigating to the main calendar view, tapping the gear in the lower-right, and then tapping "user list". This will let you see the list of users in your organization, as well as users who have applied to join it. You can approve or deny these pending users, as well as change the permissions of users that have joined the organization. You can also associate users with employees so that the app will know which employee is using. If you are not the adminstrator, you can still see this view, although you won't have access to all of the same actions as the administrator.
