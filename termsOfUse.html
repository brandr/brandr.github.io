Last updated: October 16th, 2016

<P>Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms and Conditions") carefully before using the DALC Calendar application (the "Service") operated by Robert Brandenburg in cooperation with Dolan Academy and Learning Center ("us", "we", or "our").

<P>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service.

<P>By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you may not access the Service.

<H2><B>Purchases</B></H2>

If you wish to purchase any product or service made available through the Service ("Purchase"), you may be asked to supply certain information relevant to your Purchase including, without limitation, an email address used to access the application. 

<H2><B>Subscriptions</B></H2>
Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). If you use these features, you will be billed in advance on a monthly basis via iTunes. An active subscription period (lasting one month) cannot be cancelled in the middle of its duration, and renews automatically at the end of each subscription period unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current subscription period. A subscription begins with a one-month free trial, but the subscription still must be cancelled at least 24 hours before the subscription period is over in order to avoid charges. Furthermore, any unused portion of a free trial period will be forfeited if you purchase a subscription.

<H2><B>Changes</B></H2>
We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material we will try to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.

<H2><B>Contact Us</B></H2>
